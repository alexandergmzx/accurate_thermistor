# Accurate Thermistor

This is part of a project done with @JLcastillo for water temperature control. 
The temperature sensor NTC CL-80 was parameterized to make accurate measurements. To get better measurements a substractor amplifier and a Wheatstone bridge.

The results were validated with a thermocouple connected to a Fluke meter.
